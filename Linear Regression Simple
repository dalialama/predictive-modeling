Enroll

# create a basic linear model using the following:
lm(formula(Enroll))

# 'formula' describes the model.
# For simple linear regression, this is “YVAR ~ XVAR” where YVAR is the dependent, or predicted, variable and XVAR is the independent, or predictor, variable.
# 'data' the variable that contains the dataset in thhis case 'Enroll'

# create linear model using lm(FORMULA, DATAVAR) predicting the fall of enrollment (ROLL)
# using the unemployment rate variable (UNEM)
Call:
  lm(formula = ROLL ~ UNEM, data = Enroll)

# Gives me the following intercept (3957) and the coefficient for the unemployment rate is 1134:
#  (Intercept)     UNEM  
#     3957         1134 
# Therefore, the complete regression equation is Fall Enrollment = 3957 + 1134 * Unemployment Rate.
# This equation tells us that the predicted fall enrollment for the UNM
# will increase by 1134 students for every one percent increase in the unemployment rate. 

# Predict a fall in enrollment
# Suppose that our research question asks what the expected fall enrollment is, given this year’s unemployment rate of 9%. 
Fall <- 3957 + 1134*9
Fall
#the predicted fall enrollment, given a 9% unemployment rate, is 14,163 students.

# Summarising the Model
# Here, the summary(OBJECT) function is a useful tool. It is capable of generating most of the statistical information that one would need to derive from a linear model. The example below demonstrates the use of the summary function on a linear model variable.
Call:
  summary(lm(formula = ROLL ~ UNEM, data = Enroll))

# the summary function provides us with t-test, F-test, R-squared, residual, and significance values.

# Alternative modeling functions from lm() include glm() and rlm().
